# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation

# Abstract:

* A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the e-commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.

# Problem Statement:

* Given the e-commerce data, use a k-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interests.

# Dataset Information:

* The data was collected from a well-known e-commerce website over a period of time based on the customer’s search profile.

# Scope:

* Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights about the purchase pattern
* Data pre-processing including missing value treatment
* Segmenting customers based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’) with the help of silhouette score.

# What is K-Means Clustering Algorithm?

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science. In this topic, we will learn what is K-means clustering algorithm, how the algorithm works, along with the Python implementation of k-means clustering.
